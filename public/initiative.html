        <h3><b>SEAS 180th Anniversary</b></h3>
        
        <h3><b>Stacks Re-Design</b></h3>
        <p>In 2009, the Information Technology Services (ITS) department announced a decision to reduce the number of fixed computing stations on Grounds. At the time, ITS maintained 400 computers. The number has now been reduced to only 20 computers located in the Brown Science and Engineering Library. The decision was made based on data that showed that nearly every student entered the University with a computer and that advanced software use had decreased.</p>
        <p>ITS arranged to hand the space over directly to the University. With the help of the SEAS administration, ESC petitioned the Provost’s Office to instead turn the space over to SEAS for student use. The proposal was accepted and as a result Stacks will remain a student study space.</p>
        <p>Given that SEAS had no existing furniture or plans for Stacks, ESC was tasked with providing input as to what engineering students would most like to see in a study space. Through direct consultation with SEAS students and student polling, ESC arrived at a design that incorporated group study space, plenty of available outlets, printing and copying facilities, and comfortable seating. The proposed design includes four group study pods capable of seating six, each with mounted white boards and LCD TV’s.  The design allows for informal use with roughly one sixth of the space being stuffed couches and chairs. Additionally, the design includes plenty of general study space with wheeled seating, study lamps, and outlets. Finally, the proposed design maintains the same printing and copying capabilities that Stacks currently offers.</p>

        <h3><b>Science Olympiad State Tournament</b></h3>
        <p>The UVa Engineering Student Council in partnership with the School of Engineering & Applied Science is hosting the 2016 State Science Olympiad tournament this Spring.</p>
        <p>Science Olympiad is a school-based program for students from third grade through their senior year in high school. It offers students the opportunity to improve their understanding in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and to work together in teams to learn new skills. Virginia Science Olympiad (VASO) is a non-profit organization engaging and challenging students in these disciplines through team-based competitive tournaments in Virginia.</p>
        <p>VASO seeks to inspire a passion for science and technology in Virginia's students through collaboration and teamwork, hands-on experiences, variety and creativity in topics and skills, and fun and rewarding tournaments. Events are carefully chosen by the National Science Olympiad organization to reflect national educational standardsand are changed or revised every year to allow students to learn new things. For more information on the organization, visit www.virginiaso.com.</p>
        <p>TMore information will be updated when available.</p>

        <h3><b>Student Taught Classes</b></h3>
        <p>Beginning in Spring 2013, the Engineering Student Council and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at UVa have managed the Student Taught Classes (STC) program.  The program was created to provide students an opportunity to learn skills not taught traditionally at UVa but are needed for industry and/or academia.</p>
        <h4>How are they offered?</h4>
        <p>1 Credit, Pass/Fail – You can sign up via SIS (UVa’s course registry service). Each class has a faculty advisor from the focus area being taught. Classes are listed under the faculty advisor’s name, typically with the 1501 Designator.</p>
        <h4>So you want to teach?</h4>
        <p>Do you have something you are passionate enough about that you want to teach your fellow students everything you know and then some? Stay on the lookout for applications this April 2016. </p>

        <h3><b>Current Courses:</b></h3>
        <h4>BME 1501: Current Research in Regenerative Medicine II</h4>
        <p>Instructors: Cara Broshkevitch (cjb5ac@virginia.edu) & Naveed Tavakol (naveed@virginia.edu)</p>
        <p>Time: Wednesdays, 5-5:50pm</p>
        <h4>How are they offered?</h4>
        <p>Course Description: This 1-credit pass/fail course is designed to give students an understanding and appreciation of current research in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The course is designed to help students gain technical skills associated with report writing, presentation, and discussion on scientific materials. Students will have the opportunity to delve into a variety of topics relating to regenerative medicine, analyzing some of the most recent literature in the fields of stem cell, tissue, onco-, and neural engineering. By the end of the course, students will have the ability to dissect an article to the fullest degree, breaking down a paper to its bare content. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to hear from guest speakers, participate in lab activities, and attend field trips that are unique to tissue regeneration. This is the perfect course for students interested in pursuing research or students just getting started in the field.</p>
        <h4>APMA 1501: Mathematical Techniques for Engineers</h4>
        <p>Instructor: Arun Kannan (arun@virginia.edu)</p>
        <p>Time: Thursdays, 5-5:50pm</p>
        <p>Course Description: Engineers need a broad perspective in order to approach problems from different viewpoints. However, by specializing in a specific field, engineers might miss out on some of the techniques used by other disciplines, which could in turn have expanded their skillsets. This course seeks to introduce several of these methods. Topics range broadly, from physics to computer science to finance, but there is a sequential connection between topics. For a complete list of topics, see the course schedule in the syllabus. These topics will be developed through a case study, where each week problems in a different field are solved by establishing the appropriate mathematical framework. There is a heavy emphasis on problem solving. Students will also visualize their answers in Mathematica and learn how to use the professional typesetting system LaTeX, an academic and industry standard.</p>
