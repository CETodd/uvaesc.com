<h3><b>Take Your Professor To Lunch</b></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate a smooth transition into studying and living at the University of Virginia, the Academic & Professional Development Committee of Engineering Student Council assigns incoming first year students upper-class peer advisors. The first years are placed in groups of approximately 10 to 20 students with two mentors representing a variety of disciplines and organizations across grounds.  Immediately following the Dean&#39;s orientation presentation, the students meet with their groups to learn vital engineering survival skills, and meet fellow peers who share the same academic interests.  This also provides new students an opportunity to ask questions about declaring a major, academic requirements, classes, and professors, and receive advice and guidance from upperclassmen in a casual, approachable setting. The mentors stay in contact with these students throughout the semester and help with whatever they may need.  The program is an excellent opportunity for first years to form relationships with students who have been in their shoes and are able to help during a difficult transition to college.</p>
