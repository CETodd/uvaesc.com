<h3><b>Fundraising</b></h3>
<p class="lead">The Fundraising Committee is in charge of raising revenue for council events. The main source of this funding comes from the sale of the infamous “I Are An Engineer” t-shirts and our “You Know You’ve been in Stacks too long when…” t-shirts. The committee also applies for grants and explores opportunities for corporate sponsorship on ESC’s behalf.</p>
<p class="lead">Recent items that the committee has explored for purchasing have included sweatshirts, crew necks, rain jackets, mugs, etc. If you have any merchandise you would like to see become available, please let our co-directors know!</p>
