<h3><b>Communications</b></h3>
<p class="lead">The communications committee works to facilitate cooperation and interaction between engineering student organizations, ESC, and the engineering student body. This committee is responsible for the development and publication of the Thornton Times – a newsletter that provides E-Schoolers with updates about the various activities happening around SEAS. The committee members build and maintain strong connections with engineering student organizations by visiting organization meetings throughout the semester as well as hosting its own President’s meetings.</p>
<p class="lead">One of the Communications committee’s newest goals is to work on and contribute to a end-of-the-year newsletter that highlights achievements of students working in either the Engineering CIOs or the Engineering Student Council.</p>
