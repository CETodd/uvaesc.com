<h3><b>Service and Community Outreach</b></h3>
<p class="lead">The Service and Community Outreach Committee serves to connect the engineering community to the greater University and Charlottesville area through food drives, volunteering at soup kitchens, elementary school outreach programs and more. The committee hosts the annual Pi-Miller- a 3.14 mile run to raise money for Patients and Friends Foundation through the UVa Cancer Center. Ultimately the goal of this committee is to give back to the wonderful community that has given so much to us over the years.</p>
